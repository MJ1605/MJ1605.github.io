                    <h2>How does the solar panel work?</h2>
                    <p>Solar panels are made up of smaller units called solar cells. The most common solar cells are made from silicon, a semiconductor that is the second most adundant element on Earth. In a solar cell, crystalline silicon is sandwiched between conductive layers. Each silicon atom is connected to its neighbours by four strong bonds, which keeps the electrons in place so no current can flow. Here's the key: a silicon solar cell uses two different layers of silicon. An n-type silicon has extra electrons, and p-type has extra spaces for electrons, called holes. Where the two types of silicon meets electrons can wander across the p/n junction, leaving a positive charge on one side and creative negative charge on the other. When photons from the sun aka sunlight strikes the silicon cell with enough energy, it can knock an electron from its bond, leaving a hole. The negatively charged electron and the location of the positively charged hole are now free to move around. But because of the electric field at the p/n junction, they'll only go one way. The electron is drawn to the n-side, while the hole is drawn to the p-side. The mobile electrons are collected by thin metal fingers at the top of the cell. From there, they flow through an external circuit, and flowing electrons is called current and its able to do electrical work before returning through the conductive aluminum sheet on the back, returning to where they came from.</p>
